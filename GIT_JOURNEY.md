Conflicts Resolved

Merge 1: main + dev (6 files)

Conflict 1: config/app-config.yaml

Issue: Production used port 8080, development used 3000

Resolution: Created unified config with environment-based settings

Strategy: Keep production as default, add dev as optional

Difficulty: Medium

Time: 15 minutes


Conflict 2: config/database-config.json

Issue: Different database hosts and SSL modes

Resolution: Created separate profiles for production and development

Strategy: Restructured JSON to support both environments

Difficulty: Medium

Time: 10 minutes


Conflict 3: scripts/deploy.sh

Issue: Different deployment strategies (production vs docker-compose)

Resolution: Added conditional logic based on DEPLOY_ENV variable

Strategy: Made script handle both environments dynamically

Difficulty: Hard

Time: 20 minutes


Conflict 4: scripts/monitor.js

Issue: Different monitoring intervals and log formats

Resolution: Environment-based configuration object

Strategy: Used process.env.NODE_ENV to determine behavior

Difficulty: Medium

Time: 15 minutes


Conflict 5: docs/architecture.md

Issue: Different architectural descriptions

Resolution: Merged both descriptions into comprehensive document

Strategy: Created sections for each environment

Difficulty: Easy

Time: 10 minutes


Conflict 6: README.md

Issue: Different feature lists and version numbers

Resolution: Combined all features with clear environment labels

Strategy: Organized features by category

Difficulty: Easy

Time: 10 minutes

Merge 2: main + conflict-simulator (6 files)

Conflict 1: config/app-config.yaml

Issue: The conflict-simulator branch introduced new experimental feature flags and ports for testing environments.
Resolution: Kept the stable production configuration as the default and added experimental settings under a separate "experimental" section.
Strategy: Maintain production as active; wrap new features behind an experimental flag.
Difficulty: Medium
Time: 15 minutes

Conflict 2: config/database-config.json

Issue: Conflict-simulator branch added a new "analytics" database configuration conflicting with production.
Resolution: Preserved production and development sections; added analytics as an optional block disabled by default.
Strategy: Use environment variable ENABLE_ANALYTICS_DB to toggle analytics connection.
Difficulty: Medium
Time: 10 minutes

Conflict 3: scripts/deploy.sh

Issue: The conflict-simulator branch introduced an experimental "auto-redeploy" logic that conflicted with stable deployment flow.
Resolution: Retained the multi-environment deploy script; integrated the auto-redeploy feature as optional, triggered by ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL=true.
Strategy: Add conditional logic so experimental deployments donâ€™t affect production.
Difficulty: Hard
Time: 20 minutes

Conflict 4: scripts/monitor.js

Issue: Conflict-simulator branch used new CPU/memory simulation metrics that caused log duplication.
Resolution: Merged both; production uses standard monitoring, experimental mode adds simulation logs when process.env.EXPERIMENTAL_MODE=true.
Strategy: Wrap all simulator features under a feature flag to isolate unstable logic.
Difficulty: Medium
Time: 15 minutes

Conflict 5: docs/architecture.md

Issue: New "Simulation Layer" and "Feature Toggle System" sections clashed with existing architecture layout.
Resolution: Combined both documents, adding a new subsection titled "Experimental Simulation Layer (Optional)".
Strategy: Integrate documentation while marking experimental features clearly as optional.
Difficulty: Easy
Time: 10 minutes

Conflict 6: README.md

Issue: Conflict-simulator version changed descriptions and added new badges for simulation mode.
Resolution: Merged both versions; kept main structure from production and appended an "Experimental Features" section at the end.
Strategy: Maintain clarity between stable and experimental features for readers.
Difficulty: Easy
Time: 5 minutes

After resolution note:
After resolving all six conflicts, both main and conflict-simulator branches were successfully merged. Experimental features are safely isolated behind feature flags to ensure production stability. Repository is now clean, tested, and ready for submission.


Most Challenging Parts


1. Understanding Conflict Markers: Initially confused by <<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>> symbols. Learned that HEAD is current branch and the other side is incoming changes.



2. Deciding What to Keep: Hardest part was choosing between conflicting code. Learned to read both versions completely before deciding.



3. Complex Logic Conflicts: deploy.sh had completely different logic. Had to understand both approaches before combining.



4. Testing After Resolution: Making sure resolved code actually worked was crucial.



Key Learnings

Technical Skills


Mastered conflict resolution process

Understood merge conflict markers


Learned to use git diff effectively

Practiced all major Git commands


Best Practices

Always read both sides of conflict before resolving

Test resolved code before committing

Write detailed merge commit messages

Use git status frequently


Commit atomically


Git Workflow Insights

Conflicts are normal, not errors

Take time to understand both changes

When in doubt, ask for clarification

Document your resolution strategy

Keep calm and read carefully


Reflection

This challenge taught me that merge conflicts aren't scary - they're
just Git asking "which version do you want?". The key is understanding
what each side is trying to do before combining them. I now feel
confident handling conflicts in real projects.

The hands-on practice with all Git commands (especially rebase and
cherry-pick) was invaluable. I understand the difference between merge
and rebase, and when to use each. Most importantly, I learned that
git reflog is a lifesaver!
